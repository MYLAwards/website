                    <p class="lead">It is past due that Muslims here in America [Minnesota in particular] start to concentrate and plan for
                        the future. The youth today are the future leaders of our community, and should be the focus of our
                        future planning. It is imperative for the community to invest ample energy, resources and money to
                        encourage and provide the youth with all the necessary skills needed to become exemplary human beings
                        and representatives of this noble tradition. Therefore, with the guidance of GOD Almighty, we have
                        established the first ever scholarship exclusively for Minnesota Youth.</p>
