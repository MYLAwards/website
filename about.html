                <p class="lead">It is past due that Muslims here in America [Minnesota in particular] start to
                    concentrate and plan for
                    the future. The youth today are the future leaders of our community, and should be the focus of our
                    future planning. It is imperative for the community to invest ample energy, resources and money to
                    encourage and provide the youth with all the necessary skills needed to become exemplary human
                    beings
                    and representatives of this noble tradition. Therefore, with the guidance of GOD Almighty, we have
                    established the first ever scholarship exclusively for Minnesota Youth.</p>
